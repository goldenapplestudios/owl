# WASM Component Model Guide

## Overview

The Athena Platform uses the WebAssembly Component Model to create secure, isolated, and composable agent modules.

## Architecture

Each agent is built as a WASM component with:
- Strict capability-based security
- Resource isolation
- Cross-component communication via well-defined interfaces
- Hot-reloading support

## Building Components

### Prerequisites

```bash
rustup target add wasm32-wasi
cargo install cargo-component
```

### Component Structure

```rust
use spin_sdk::http_component;

#[http_component]
async fn handle_request(req: Request) -> Result<Response> {
    // Component logic
}
```

### Compilation

```bash
cargo component build --release
```

## Component Interfaces

Components communicate through WIT (WebAssembly Interface Types):

```wit
interface agent {
    record analysis-request {
        id: string,
        data: list<u8>,
        options: option<analysis-options>,
    }
    
    record analysis-response {
        id: string,
        results: list<finding>,
        confidence: float32,
    }
    
    analyze: func(request: analysis-request) -> result<analysis-response, string>
}
```

## Security Model

- Components run in isolated sandboxes
- Explicit capability grants required
- No ambient authority
- Resource limits enforced

## Performance Optimization

1. **Near-native performance**: WASM JIT compilation
2. **Minimal cold starts**: < 1Î¼s startup time
3. **Efficient memory usage**: Linear memory model
4. **SIMD support**: For ML workloads

## Deployment

Components can be deployed to:
- Spin runtime
- wasmCloud
- Fastly Compute@Edge
- Any WASI-compliant runtime
